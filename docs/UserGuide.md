### What is Javatro?

#### Introduction
**Javatro** is a strategic, card-based game inspired by Poker but with a twist. The objective of the game is to score the highest points by creating valid poker hands from the cards dealt. It adds a layer of complexity with various deck types and special mechanics, making it a unique experience.

---

#### Objective
The objective of **Javatro** is to accumulate points by forming valid Poker hands. Players must strategically choose which cards to play, discard, or hold onto to achieve the highest-scoring hand.

---

### Core Mechanics

#### 1. Deck Types
In **Balatro**, players can choose from various decks, each with unique rules or bonuses. The standard decks include:

- **Red Deck**: Grants the player one additional discard per round.
- **Blue Deck**: Grants the player one additional hand per round.
- **Checkered Deck**: Starts with 26 Hearts and 26 Spades, offering more opportunities to form suited hands.
- **Abandoned Deck**: Removes all face cards (King, Queen, Jack) from the deck, making it harder to form high-ranking hands.

---

#### 2. Blinds
Before the start of a game round, players select a **Blind** which determines the minimum score they need to beat to proceed. The available blinds are:

- **Small Blind**: A low score requirement (e.g., 300 points).
- **Large Blind**: A moderate score requirement (e.g., 450 points).
- **Boss Blind**: A high score requirement (e.g., 600 points).

Blinds influence the difficulty of the round and the rewards earned upon completion.

---

#### 3. Rounds and Hands
The game progresses through several **Rounds**, with each round having a limited number of **Hands**. The player must achieve the required score within the allowed hands to progress.

- **Ante**: This represents the round number, starting from 1 and increasing with each successful completion.
- **Hands**: The number of attempts available to reach the required score. This is usually limited and can be affected by deck type (e.g., Blue Deck offers an extra hand).

---

#### 4. Jokers’ Effects
The game may have **Joker Slots** that provide special abilities or bonuses when utilized. By default, these slots are empty but may be activated based on game progression or deck type.

---

#### 5. Cards and Poker Hands
Players are dealt cards at the start of each round. The objective is to arrange these cards into valid **Poker Hands**. Common Poker Hands include:

- **High Card**: The highest card in the hand when no other combination is made.
- **Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.
- **Two Pair**: Two separate pairs.
- **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.
- **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of varying suits.
- **Flush**: Five cards of the same suit.
- **Full House**: A combination of a Three of a Kind and a Pair.
- **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank.
- **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit.
- **Royal Flush**: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten of the same suit.

Each Poker Hand is worth a specific amount of points. Higher-ranking hands yield more points. Javatro provides options for the player to easily see different statistics to help them plan and optimise.
